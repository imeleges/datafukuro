                                                Accessible historical data includes game sales, user and expert ratings, game genres, and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation).
                                                The dataset includes the abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), an organization that sets age ratings for computer games. The ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it an appropriate age category, such as <b>E - Everyone</b>, <b>T - Teen</b>, <b>M - Mature 17+</b>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                A lot of work and analysis has been done to identify the patterns that determine a game's success. The success of a game depends on various factors that should be considered collectively, as individually, these factors could be anomalies or outliers.

                                                Critics' ratings are significantly more important than user ratings, which is especially evident in the American and European markets. However, in Japan, the difference in influence between the two is considerably smaller.

                                            <p>
                                                The active usage of gaming platforms lasts approximately 3-5 years, after which their relevance declines. This should be taken into account when ordering new games. The "lifespan" of a gaming platform is associated with technological development and the emergence of new platforms. However, for instance, the PC platform serves not only for gaming but primarily as a personal computer, it has a larger user base and its "lifespan" will be significantly longer for new games.

                                                In conclusion, for ordering new games for the next year, suggestion for the platforms worth investing in are X360, PS3, the new PS4, XOne, and perhaps PC. As for genres, Action, Shooter, Sports, Role-Playing, and Misc are recommended. Considering the Japanese market, the Fighting genre should be looked into.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Regarding other platforms and genres, it would be wise to focus on individual games with high critic ratings. As shown with the example of Wii Sports for the Wii platform, anomalously high performance games can significantly skew perceptions of a certain genre or platform.
                                            </p>
                                            <p> 
                                                The acquired data, charts, and conclusions should be enough to invest in potentially popular products and plan advertising campaigns.
